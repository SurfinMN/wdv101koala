      <h2>Adopt a Koala</h2>
      <p>Adopting a koala helps us protect these precious animals and their habitats. Your adoption supports vital research, conservation efforts, and education programs that contribute to koala preservation.</p>
      <p>When you adopt a koala, you receive an adoption certificate and regular updates on your adopted koalaâ€™s progress. Additionally, your support allows us to continue vital work such as habitat restoration, wildlife research, and public education.</p>
      <p>To adopt a koala, simply fill out the adoption form on this page and make a donation. Your donation goes directly to supporting the care and protection of koalas and their environment.</p>
